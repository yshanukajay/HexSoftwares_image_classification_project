📌 Project Description — Face Mask Detection Model

HexSoftwares_image_classification_project is a machine-learning project I created during my internship at Hex Softwares Pvt. Ltd.
The main goal of this project is to build an efficient image classification model that can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

This repository currently contains the Face_Mask_Detection model folder, which includes all essential components such as the trained model, preprocessing steps, and supporting files. The model is designed using deep learning techniques and can be used for real-time or batch image prediction tasks.

✅ Features

Detects Mask vs. No Mask from images

Uses deep learning / CNN-based architecture

Easy to integrate into applications

Lightweight and suitable for deployment

🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work on end-to-end machine learning workflows

Build classification models

Organize ML project structures professionally

Contribute to real-world solutions during my internship

📂 Current Repository Content
